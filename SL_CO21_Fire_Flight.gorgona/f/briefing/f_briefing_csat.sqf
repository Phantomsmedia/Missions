<br/>
A defector from Russia recently took residence in Gorgona. A corrupt politician managed to give full operation rights to Russia in order for us to kill the defector without starting an incident with Gorgona. A corrupt policeman told his cops to turn a blind eye to the military, although many of his men have been bought out by the defector. A corrupt civilian has given us the locations of the defector, politician and cop. Now we need to clean up loose ends and kill that defector.
