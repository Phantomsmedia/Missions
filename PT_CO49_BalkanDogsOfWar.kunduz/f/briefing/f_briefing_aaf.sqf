Our contact has not given us any information past what we won't be dealing with. We will not be dealing with heavy armor, AA or anything heavy in general. It is general info that insurgents are operating in the area with small arms.
<br/>
The Blackhawk was shot down as it left a German FOB last night. Luckily we were in the area for the contract to get sent to us. The item that shot it down was theorized to be small arms, since satellite imagery shows a very intact Blackhawk at the crash site. 
<br/>
A few technicals were spotted by the satellite imagery and forward teams, but otherwise we don't know what we are dealing with.
<br/><br/>
<font size='18'>ENEMY FORCES</font>
<br/>
Entirely unknown. Enemy most likely insurgents from the local area.
<br/><br/>
<font size='18'>FRIENDLY FORCES</font>
<br/>
Our security team, armed with a few vehicles.
<br/>
We have speciality teams available, as well as a few more entertaining assets.
